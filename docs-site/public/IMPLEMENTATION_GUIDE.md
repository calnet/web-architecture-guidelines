```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/calnet/web-architecture-guidelines.git
cd web-architecture-guidelines

# Run the complete setup
./setup-enhanced-workflow.sh
```

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual installation or need to set up components individually:

#### Step 1: Create GitHub Workflows
```bash
scripts/create-workflows.sh
```

#### Step 2: Create Custom Commands
```bash
scripts/create-commands.sh
```

#### Step 3: Create Monitoring Scripts
```bash
scripts/create-monitoring.sh
```

#### Step 4: Create Documentation
```bash
scripts/create-docs.sh
```

#### Step 5: Configure Repository Secrets
```bash
# Set the Anthropic API key
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --body "your-anthropic-api-key-here"

# Verify secret is set
gh secret list
```

### Verification

Test the complete installation:

```bash
# Run comprehensive test
scripts/test-workflow.sh

# Check system health
scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --report
```

## Configuration

### Repository Secrets

The system requires the following repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose | Required |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude API access | Yes |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Automatic (GitHub provides) | Yes |

Configure secrets via GitHub UI or CLI:

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --body "your-api-key"

# Via GitHub UI
# Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
```

### Workflow Configuration

Workflows are configured through YAML files in `.github/workflows/`:

#### Main Workflow (`claude-code-review.yml`)
- **Triggers**: PR creation, updates, issue comments with `@claude`
- **Model**: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
- **Max Tokens**: 4000 for PR reviews, 8000 for comprehensive audits
- **Features**: Custom command detection, security validation, performance checks

#### Advanced Workflow (`advanced-architecture-review.yml`)  
- **Triggers**: PRs to main branch, manual dispatch
- **Strategy**: Matrix build for parallel analysis
- **Focus Areas**: Architecture, security, performance, documentation, accessibility
- **Integration**: Cross-reference validation and integration assessment

### Custom Commands Configuration

Commands are defined in `.claude/commands/` and can be customized by editing the markdown files:

```bash
# Edit command behavior
vi .claude/commands/security-scan.md

# Test command after changes
gh pr comment [PR-URL] --body "/security-scan Test the updated command"
```

## Usage

### Automatic Reviews

The system automatically reviews code on:
- Pull request creation
- Pull request updates  
- Push to watched branches

No manual intervention required - Claude will post review comments automatically.

### Manual Reviews

Trigger reviews manually by commenting on PRs or issues:

```bash
# General review
@claude Please review this PR

# With specific focus
@claude Please review this PR focusing on security
```

### Custom Commands

Use specialized commands for focused analysis:

#### Architecture Review
```bash
/architecture-review "Review the new user authentication module"
```

#### Security Scan
```bash  
/security-scan "Check the API endpoints for OWASP compliance"
```

#### Performance Check
```bash
/performance-check "Analyze database query optimizations"
```

#### Documentation Audit
```bash
/documentation-audit "Review API documentation completeness"
```

#### Quick Fix
```bash
/quick-fix "Fix formatting and style issues in user service"
```

### Scheduled Reviews

The system performs weekly comprehensive audits:
- **Schedule**: Mondays at 9 AM UTC
- **Scope**: Full codebase analysis
- **Output**: Detailed issue with findings and recommendations
- **Integration**: Creates GitHub issues for tracking

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

Monitor system health regularly:

```bash
# Basic health check
scripts/monitor-workflow.sh

# Detailed health report
scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --report
```

### Performance Metrics

The monitoring system tracks:
- **Workflow Success Rate**: Target >95%
- **Average Execution Time**: Target <5 minutes
- **API Rate Limits**: GitHub and Anthropic usage
- **Failure Patterns**: Analysis of common issues

### Alerts and Notifications

Set up monitoring alerts:

```bash
# Add to crontab for regular monitoring
crontab -e
# Add: 0 */6 * * * /path/to/scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --report
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Failures
```bash
# Check GitHub CLI auth
gh auth status

# Re-authenticate if needed
gh auth login

# Verify API key secret
gh secret list | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

#### Workflow Not Triggering
```bash
# Check workflow files exist
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Verify workflow syntax
gh workflow list

# Check recent runs
gh run list --limit 10
```

#### Custom Commands Not Working
```bash
# Verify command files exist
ls -la .claude/commands/

# Check command file format
cat .claude/commands/architecture-review.md

# Test with manual trigger
gh pr comment [PR-URL] --body "@claude /architecture-review test"
```

#### Poor Performance
```bash
# Check API rate limits
gh api rate_limit

# Monitor workflow duration
scripts/monitor-workflow.sh

# Review workflow logs
gh run view [RUN-ID] --log
```

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
# View workflow logs
gh run list --limit 5
gh run view [RUN-ID] --log

# Check system health
scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --report

# Run comprehensive test
scripts/test-workflow.sh
```

### Support

For additional support:
1. Check the monitoring logs: `workflow-monitor.log`
2. Review GitHub Actions logs
3. Validate configuration with health checks
4. Test with minimal PR to isolate issues

## Customization

### Workflow Customization

Modify workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

```yaml

1. **Protect API keys** - never commit secrets
2. **Limit access** to repository secrets
3. **Monitor usage** to detect anomalies
4. **Regular rotation** of API keys
5. **Audit permissions** regularly

### Performance
1. **Monitor execution times** and optimize prompts
2. **Manage API limits** to avoid rate limiting
3. **Cache results** where appropriate
4. **Optimize workflow triggers** to reduce unnecessary runs
5. **Review costs** regularly

### Maintenance
1. **Update dependencies** regularly
2. **Review and update prompts** based on feedback
3. **Monitor external changes** to APIs and actions
4. **Backup configurations** before changes
5. **Document customizations** for team knowledge
