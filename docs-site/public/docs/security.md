# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices and guidelines for web application development. These guidelines help ensure applications are built with security-by-design principles and protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Require MFA for all administrative accounts
- Support multiple authentication factors (SMS, email, authenticator apps, hardware tokens)
- Implement backup authentication methods for account recovery

### Password Security

- Enforce strong password policies (minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements)
- Implement password history to prevent reuse of recent passwords
- Use secure password hashing algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2)
- Implement account lockout mechanisms after failed attempts

### Session Management

- Use secure session tokens with appropriate expiration times
- Implement session timeout for inactive users
- Regenerate session IDs after authentication
- Store session data securely and validate session integrity

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption
- Use TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- Implement proper key management and rotation procedures
- Never store encryption keys with encrypted data

### Personal Data Handling

- Minimize collection and retention of personal data
- Implement data anonymization and pseudonymization techniques
- Provide data export and deletion capabilities for user rights
- Maintain audit logs for all personal data access and modifications

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Validation Rules

- Validate all input on both client and server sides
- Use whitelist validation rather than blacklist approaches
- Implement proper type checking and format validation
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing or storage

### SQL Injection Prevention

- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
- Avoid dynamic SQL construction with user input
- Implement proper database access controls and permissions
- Regularly audit database queries for vulnerabilities

## Security Headers and Policies

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; 
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
```

### Additional Security Headers

- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Force HTTPS connections
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevent clickjacking attacks
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevent MIME type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy`: Control referrer information sharing

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

- Monitor failed authentication attempts and suspicious patterns
- Track privilege escalations and access to sensitive resources
- Implement real-time alerting for security events
- Maintain comprehensive audit logs for compliance and investigation

### Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Identify and verify security incidents
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and prevent spread
3. **Investigation**: Analyze the incident and determine impact
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations and apply fixes
5. **Documentation**: Record lessons learned and update procedures

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regular Security Audits

- Conduct quarterly security assessments and penetration testing
- Review access permissions and user privileges regularly
- Audit third-party integrations and dependencies
- Document and track remediation of identified vulnerabilities

### Compliance Requirements

- Implement controls for relevant standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
- Maintain documentation for compliance audits
- Regular training for development and operations teams
- Establish data breach notification procedures
