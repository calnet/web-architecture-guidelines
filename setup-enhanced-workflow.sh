- Add GitHub workflows for automated code review
- Create custom Claude commands for specialized analysis
- Implement comprehensive documentation
- Update CLAUDE.md with enhanced instructions

This implements a comprehensive system for:
- Automated PR reviews with Claude
- Custom slash commands for specialized analysis
- Enhanced documentation and guides

Components created:
- GitHub workflows (claude-code-review.yml, advanced-architecture-review.yml)
- Custom commands (architecture-review, security-scan, performance-check, documentation-audit, quick-fix)
- Enhanced documentation (CLAUDE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md, WORKFLOW_README.md)

Setup completed with core components ready for use."

This PR implements a comprehensive enhanced Claude Code Review workflow system with modular scripts and automation.

### üöÄ New Features

#### GitHub Workflows
- **claude-code-review.yml**: Main automated review workflow
- **advanced-architecture-review.yml**: Multi-stage comprehensive analysis

#### Custom Claude Commands
- \`/architecture-review\`: Comprehensive architecture analysis
- \`/security-scan\`: Security vulnerability assessment  
- \`/performance-check\`: Performance optimization review
- \`/documentation-audit\`: Documentation quality validation
- \`/quick-fix\`: Quick fix implementation

#### Enhanced Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Enhanced Claude instructions
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**: Complete implementation guide
- **WORKFLOW_README.md**: Usage and maintenance documentation

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Requirements

1. **Configure Repository Secrets**:
   \`\`\`bash
   gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --body \"your-api-key\"
   \`\`\`

2. **Test Custom Commands**: Use them in PR comments
3. **Monitor System Health**: Use scripts/monitor-workflow.sh (create separately)

### üìã Quality Assurance

- ‚úÖ All scripts follow established patterns
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Dry-run support for safe testing
- ‚úÖ Modular design for easy maintenance
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing validation tools

### üîÑ Workflow Integration

The system integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows:
- Automatic reviews on PR creation/updates
- Manual triggers via \`@claude\` mentions
- Custom commands for specialized analysis
- Enhanced documentation and instructions

### üìñ Usage

See the complete guides:
- \`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md\` - Setup and configuration
- \`WORKFLOW_README.md\` - Daily usage and maintenance
- \`CLAUDE.md\` - Enhanced Claude instructions
