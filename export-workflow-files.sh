### Basic Workflow Usage
1. **Automatic Triggers:** Workflow runs on PR creation, updates, and issue comments
2. **Manual Triggers:** Comment `@claude` in PRs or issues for manual review
3. **Custom Commands:** Use slash commands for specific types of analysis
4. **Scheduled Reviews:** Weekly comprehensive audits run automatically

### Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Daily:** Run `./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh` for health check
2. **Weekly:** Review workflow performance and update dependencies
3. **Monthly:** Comprehensive audit and optimization

### Testing the Implementation
```bash
# 1. Create test PR
git checkout -b test/workflow-validation
echo "# Test" >> TEST.md
git add TEST.md
git commit -m "test: validate workflow"
git push origin test/workflow-validation
gh pr create --title "Test: Workflow" --body "Testing enhanced workflow"

# 2. Trigger Claude review
gh pr comment [PR-URL] --body "@claude Please review this test PR"

# 3. Monitor results
./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ 95%+ workflow success rate
- ✅ <5 minutes average execution time
- ✅ Zero authentication failures
- ✅ Comprehensive architectural feedback
- ✅ Improved code quality scores

## Troubleshooting
- **Authentication Issues:** Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret
- **Slow Performance:** Check API rate limits and optimize prompts
- **Missing Feedback:** Ensure @claude mentions are properly formatted
- **Workflow Failures:** Review logs and check permissions

## Custom Command Usage

### Architecture Review
```bash
# In Claude Code terminal or PR comment
/architecture-review "Review the new user authentication module"
```

### Security Scan
```bash
/security-scan "Check the API endpoints for OWASP compliance"
```

### Performance Check
```bash
/performance-check "Analyze database query optimizations"
```

### Documentation Audit
```bash
/documentation-audit "Review API documentation completeness"
```

### Quick Fix
```bash
/quick-fix "Fix formatting and style issues in user service"
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor workflow performance for first week
2. Gather feedback from development team
3. Optimize prompts based on usage patterns
4. Expand custom commands as needed
5. Integrate with additional tools (JIRA, Slack, etc.)

## Support and Maintenance

### Daily Health Checks
```bash
# Run monitoring script
./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh

# Check for failed runs
gh run list --repo calnet/web-architecture-guidelines --status failure --limit 5

# View detailed logs for failed runs
gh run view [RUN_ID] --log
```

### Weekly Maintenance
```bash
# Check for workflow updates
gh workflow list --repo calnet/web-architecture-guidelines

# Review secret expiration
gh secret list --repo calnet/web-architecture-guidelines

# Update dependencies if needed
# Check https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/releases
```

### Monthly Optimization
1. Review workflow performance metrics
2. Analyze feedback quality and relevance
3. Update CLAUDE.md based on learnings
4. Optimize custom commands based on usage
5. Update documentation templates as needed

## Integration with Development Workflow

### For Developers
- Automatic reviews on every PR
- Clear, actionable feedback with specific examples
- Integration with existing GitHub workflow
- Custom commands for specialized analysis

### For Architects
- Consistent enforcement of architecture principles
- Automated compliance checking against guidelines
- Data-driven insights into code quality trends
- Proactive identification of technical debt

### For DevOps

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Check secrets
gh secret list

# View workflow logs
gh run view [RUN_ID] --log

# Cancel stuck workflow
gh run cancel [RUN_ID]

# Test authentication
gh auth status
```
