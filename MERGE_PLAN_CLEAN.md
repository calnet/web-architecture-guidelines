# Comprehensive Merge Commit Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic approach to merge branch
`copilot/fix-6e0c749c-5f83-43a4-a0d8-b5dd3fc86735` into `develop`. The merge
involves significant conflicts due to parallel development tracks with 67
commits on develop vs 24 commits on the feature branch.

## Current State Analysis

### Branch Divergence Point

- **Common Ancestor:** `6bb39a5` - "Initial plan"
- **Current Branch:** 24 commits ahead (comprehensive repository cleanup)
- **Develop Branch:** 67 commits ahead (extensive workflow and security
  improvements)

### Major Conflict Categories

Based on merge conflict analysis, conflicts fall into these categories:

1. **Workflow Configuration Files (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - `.github/workflows/base-compliance.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/sync-templates.yml`

2. **Core Documentation Files (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - `README.md`
   - `CLAUDE.md`
   - `docs/version-management-guide.md`
   - `tsconfig.json`

3. **AI Agent Instructions (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
   - `docs/ai-agents/anthropic-api-architecture-instructions.md`
   - `docs/ai-agents/chatgpt-architecture-instructions.md`
   - `docs/ai-agents/copilot-architecture-instructions.md`
   - `docs/ai-agents/gemini-architecture-instructions.md`

4. **Template Files (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
   - `docs/templates/*.md` (multiple template files)
   - `docs/templates/VERSION`

5. **Documentation Site Files (LOW PRIORITY)**
   - `docs-site/public/*.md`
   - `docs-site/src/components/DocumentationPage.tsx`

6. **Project Configuration (LOW PRIORITY)**
   - `package.json`
   - `.gitignore`
   - Various metadata files

## Merge Strategy Options

### Option 1: Sequential Resolution Merge (RECOMMENDED)

**Approach:** Resolve conflicts in priority order, committing incrementally

**Advantages:**

- Maintains detailed history of resolution decisions
- Allows for testing at each stage
- Easier to revert specific conflict resolutions
- Better for code review

**Steps:**

1. Create backup branch
2. Merge develop into feature branch (easier conflict resolution)
3. Resolve HIGH PRIORITY conflicts first
4. Test and validate each resolution
5. Merge feature branch into develop

## Recommended Resolution Strategy

### Phase 1: Pre-Merge Preparation

```bash
# 1. Create backup of current branch
git checkout copilot/fix-6e0c749c-5f83-43a4-a0d8-b5dd3fc86735
git branch backup-pre-merge-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# 2. Fetch latest develop
git fetch origin develop

# 3. Create merge preparation branch
git checkout -b merge-prep-develop
```text

### Phase 2: Conflict Resolution Priority Matrix

#### HIGH PRIORITY (Must Resolve First)

1. **Workflow Files** - Use develop versions (more advanced security)
2. **README.md** - Merge content, prioritize develop structure
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Use develop version (consolidated instructions)
4. **version-management-guide.md** - Use develop version (enhanced system)

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY

1. **AI Agent Instructions** - Merge unique improvements from both branches
2. **Template Files** - Use develop versions with markdownlint compliance
3. **Architecture Documents** - Merge content improvements

#### LOW PRIORITY

1. **Documentation Site** - Use current branch versions (cleaner structure)
2. **Package Configuration** - Merge dependencies, use develop scripts

### Phase 3: Specific Conflict Resolution Rules

#### Workflow Files Resolution

- **Base Strategy:** Use develop versions
- **Rationale:** Develop has critical security fixes and permissions
- **Exception:** Preserve any unique functionality from current branch

#### Documentation Resolution

- **Base Strategy:** Content merge with develop structure
- **Rationale:** Develop has better organization and version management
- **Process:**
  1. Keep develop file structure
  2. Merge unique content from current branch
  3. Maintain version consistency

#### AI Agent Instructions Resolution

- **Base Strategy:** Intelligent merge
- **Process:**
  1. Use develop's consolidated structure
  2. Add any unique instructions from current branch
  3. Maintain version markers and formatting

### Phase 4: Validation Steps

1. **Lint Check:** Run markdownlint on all resolved files
2. **Workflow Validation:** Test GitHub Actions syntax
3. **Link Validation:** Check all internal links work
4. **Template Compliance:** Run template checker
5. **Build Test:** Ensure docs-site builds successfully

### Phase 5: Final Merge Process

```bash
# 1. Merge develop into preparation branch
git merge develop --no-ff

# 2. Resolve conflicts systematically
# (Follow priority matrix above)

# 3. Validate all changes
npm run lint
npm run test
./scripts/validate-docs-structure.sh

# 4. Commit resolved merge
git commit -m "Merge develop: resolve conflicts and integrate improvements"

# 5. Switch to develop and merge
git checkout develop
git merge merge-prep-develop --no-ff

# 6. Clean up
git branch -d merge-prep-develop
```text

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy

- Create timestamped backup branches before each major step
- Tag important milestones during resolution process
- Keep original branch intact until merge is validated

### Testing Protocol

1. Automated tests after each conflict resolution phase
2. Manual review of critical workflow files
3. Documentation site build test
4. Link validation across all files

### Rollback Plan

- If merge introduces breaking changes, rollback to backup branch
- Use `git revert` for specific problematic commits
- Maintain communication with team during process

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All merge conflicts resolved
- [ ] No broken workflows or build processes
- [ ] Documentation consistency maintained
- [ ] Version management system intact
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Clean commit history preserved

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Prep):** 15 minutes
- **Phase 2-3 (Resolution):** 2-3 hours
- **Phase 4 (Validation):** 30 minutes
- **Phase 5 (Final Merge):** 15 minutes
- **Total:** 3-4 hours

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this merge plan
2. Schedule dedicated time for merge execution
3. Execute merge following this strategy
4. Validate results and update documentation
