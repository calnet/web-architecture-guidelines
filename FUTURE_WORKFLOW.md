# Going Forward: Proper Branch Structure

## Current State

- All previous work is committed to `develop`
- Branching strategy documentation is now in place
- Ready to start using proper feature branches

## Next Steps for New Work

### 1. Always Start from Develop

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop  # Ensure you have latest changes
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch

```bash
# For documentation site work:
git checkout -b feature/docs-site-[feature-name]

# For template improvements:
git checkout -b feature/templates-[improvement-name] 

# For validation tools:
git checkout -b feature/validation-[tool-name]

# For architecture docs:
git checkout -b feature/architecture-[section-name]

# For maintenance:
git checkout -b chore/[task-name]
```

### 3. Work and Commit with Proper Messages

```bash
git commit -m "feat(scope): add new functionality"
git commit -m "fix(scope): resolve specific issue"
git commit -m "docs(scope): update documentation"
git commit -m "style(scope): improve formatting"
git commit -m "refactor(scope): restructure code"
git commit -m "test(scope): add test coverage"
git commit -m "chore(scope): maintenance task"
```

### 4. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push -u origin feature/branch-name
# Then create PR through GitHub interface
```

### 5. After Merge, Clean Up

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/branch-name
git remote prune origin  # Clean up remote tracking branches
```

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Clear History**: Each feature has its own branch and PR  
✅ **Code Reviews**: All changes go through review process  
✅ **Rollback Safety**: Easy to revert specific features  
✅ **Parallel Work**: Multiple people can work on different features  
✅ **Release Management**: Clean develop branch for releases  
✅ **Documentation**: PRs provide context for changes  

## Branch Naming Examples

- `feature/docs-site-search-functionality`
- `feature/templates-api-spec-enhancements`
- `feature/validation-performance-checks`
- `feature/architecture-microservices-patterns`
- `fix/templates-broken-links`
- `chore/deps-update-react-19`
- `docs/readme-installation-updates`
