## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Workflow Not Triggering
- Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret is configured
- Check workflow files exist in `.github/workflows/`
- Ensure PR targets correct branches (main, develop)

#### Authentication Errors
- Verify GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Check API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Ensure repository permissions are correct

#### Custom Commands Not Working
- Verify command files exist in `.claude/commands/`
- Check command syntax in PR comments
- Ensure workflow has been triggered recently

#### Performance Issues
- Monitor API rate limits: `gh api rate_limit`
- Check workflow execution times
- Review and optimize prompts if needed

### Getting Help
- Check system health: `scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --report`
- View workflow logs: `gh run list` and `gh run view [RUN_ID] --log`
- Run comprehensive test: `scripts/test-workflow.sh`

## Integration with Development Workflow

### For Developers
- Automatic reviews on every PR with clear, actionable feedback
- Custom commands for specialized analysis needs
- Integration with existing GitHub workflow
- Educational feedback to improve coding skills

### For Architects
- Consistent enforcement of architecture principles
