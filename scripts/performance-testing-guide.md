# Performance Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides documentation for performance testing approaches that can be
applied to web applications built using these architecture guidelines.

## Performance Testing Categories

### 1. Frontend Performance Testing

**Core Web Vitals Testing:**

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5 seconds
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100 milliseconds  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1

**Tools:**

- Lighthouse CI for automated testing
- WebPageTest for detailed analysis
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab

### 2. Backend Performance Testing

**API Performance Testing:**

- Response time targets: < 200ms for 95th percentile
- Throughput targets: Based on expected load
- Error rate: < 0.1% under normal load

**Database Performance Testing:**

- Query performance monitoring
- Connection pool efficiency
- Index optimization validation

### 3. Load Testing

**Recommended Tools:**

- k6 for modern load testing
- Artillery for API load testing
- Apache JMeter for comprehensive testing

**Test Scenarios:**

- Normal load: Expected concurrent users
- Stress load: 2x normal load
- Spike load: Sudden traffic increases
- Volume load: Large data sets

## Implementation for Documentation Repository

Since this is a documentation-only repository, performance testing focuses on:

1. **Documentation Build Performance**: Ensuring documentation site builds
efficiently
2. **Link Validation Performance**: Fast validation of documentation links  
3. **Template Processing Performance**: Efficient template generation and
validation

## Monitoring Performance

For applications built using these guidelines:

1. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**
2. **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**
3. **Synthetic Monitoring**
4. **Infrastructure Monitoring**

## Best Practices

- Establish performance budgets before development
- Implement continuous performance testing in CI/CD
- Monitor performance in production
- Set up alerting for performance degradation
- Regular performance reviews and optimization

*Note: This documentation repository focuses on architectural guidelines.
Specific performance testing implementations should be added to individual
projects based on their technology stack and requirements.*
