# Performance Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides performance optimization guidelines and best practices for building fast, scalable web applications. It covers frontend optimization, backend performance, database tuning, and monitoring strategies.

## Frontend Performance

### Core Web Vitals

#### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

- Target: < 2.5 seconds
- Optimize images with modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Use CDN for static assets delivery
- Minimize render-blocking resources

#### First Input Delay (FID)

- Target: < 100 milliseconds  
- Minimize JavaScript execution time
- Break up long-running tasks
- Use web workers for heavy computations
- Optimize event handlers

#### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

- Target: < 0.1
- Reserve space for images and ads
- Use font-display: swap for web fonts
- Avoid inserting content above existing content
- Size images and video elements properly

### Code Optimization

#### Bundle Optimization

- Implement code splitting for route-based chunking
- Use tree shaking to eliminate dead code
- Minimize and compress JavaScript and CSS files
- Use dynamic imports for conditional features
- Analyze bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer

#### Caching Strategies

- Implement service workers for offline functionality
- Use browser caching with appropriate cache headers
- Implement application-level caching for API responses
- Use memoization for expensive computations
- Cache static assets with long expiration times

## Backend Performance

### Database Optimization

#### Query Performance

- Use proper indexing for frequently queried columns
- Implement query result caching with Redis
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Optimize N+1 query problems with eager loading
- Monitor slow queries and optimize regularly

#### Database Design

- Normalize data to reduce redundancy
- Use appropriate data types for storage efficiency
- Implement read replicas for scaling read operations
- Use database partitioning for large tables
- Regular database maintenance and cleanup

### API Performance

#### Response Optimization

- Implement API response caching
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Compress responses with gzip/brotli
- Minimize payload size with field selection
- Use HTTP/2 for multiplexed requests

#### Rate Limiting and Throttling

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use request queuing for high-traffic endpoints
- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Use load balancing for traffic distribution

## Caching Strategies

### Multi-Level Caching

#### Browser Caching

```http
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
ETag: "abc123"
```

#### CDN Caching

- Cache static assets at edge locations
- Use cache invalidation for content updates
- Implement geographic distribution
- Monitor cache hit rates and performance

#### Application Caching

- Cache database query results
- Use in-memory caching for session data
- Implement cache warming strategies
- Monitor cache performance and hit rates

#### Database Caching

- Use query result caching
- Implement read-through caching patterns
- Use write-behind caching for performance
- Monitor cache consistency and invalidation

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Performance Monitoring

#### Real User Monitoring (RUM)

- Track Core Web Vitals from real users
- Monitor page load times and user interactions
- Analyze performance by geography and device
- Set up alerts for performance regressions

#### Synthetic Monitoring

- Regular automated performance testing
- Monitor critical user journeys
- Test from multiple locations and devices
- Track performance over time

### Performance Budgets

#### Establishing Budgets

- Set limits for bundle sizes and load times
- Define performance budgets for different pages
- Monitor and enforce budgets in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular review and adjustment of budgets

#### Budget Examples

```json
{
  "budgets": [
    {
      "type": "bundle",
      "name": "main",
      "maximumWarning": "500kb",
      "maximumError": "1mb"
    },
    {
      "type": "initial",
      "maximumWarning": "2mb",
      "maximumError": "3mb"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

#### Load Balancing

- Distribute traffic across multiple servers
- Use health checks for server availability
- Implement session affinity when needed
- Monitor server performance and capacity

#### Microservices Architecture

- Design services for independent scaling
- Use event-driven communication
- Implement service discovery and routing
- Monitor inter-service communication

### Vertical Scaling

#### Resource Optimization

- Monitor CPU, memory, and I/O usage
- Implement auto-scaling based on metrics
- Optimize resource allocation for containers
- Regular capacity planning and forecasting
