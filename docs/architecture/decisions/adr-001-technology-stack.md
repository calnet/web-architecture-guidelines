# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team, Development Team  
**Supersedes**: N/A  

## Context

We need to establish a standard technology stack for web application development across our organization. The selected technologies should support scalability, maintainability, developer productivity, and long-term sustainability.

## Decision Drivers

- Developer experience and productivity
- Community support and ecosystem maturity
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Type safety and code quality
- Learning curve for new team members
- Long-term maintenance and support

## Options Considered

### Frontend Framework Options

1. **React with TypeScript** 
   - Pros: Large ecosystem, excellent TypeScript support, component reusability, strong community
   - Cons: Learning curve, requires additional libraries for complete solution

2. **Vue.js with TypeScript**
   - Pros: Gentler learning curve, good TypeScript support, comprehensive framework
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem compared to React, less job market demand

3. **Angular**
   - Pros: Complete framework, excellent TypeScript integration, enterprise-ready
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve, more opinionated, heavyweight for smaller projects

### Backend Framework Options

1. **Node.js with Express/Fastify**
   - Pros: JavaScript/TypeScript everywhere, large ecosystem, familiar to frontend developers
   - Cons: Single-threaded limitations, potential performance bottlenecks

2. **Python with FastAPI**
   - Pros: Excellent developer experience, automatic API documentation, strong typing
   - Cons: Different language from frontend, deployment complexity

3. **Go with Gin/Echo**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, simple deployment, strong standard library
   - Cons: Different paradigm, smaller web ecosystem

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the following technology stack:

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18+** with **TypeScript** as the primary frontend framework
- **Next.js** for SSR/SSG capabilities and full-stack features
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Zustand** for client state management

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js 18+ LTS** as the runtime environment
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience
- **Fastify** as the web framework for better performance than Express
- **Prisma** as the ORM for database interactions
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database

### Supporting Technologies
- **Redis** for caching and session storage
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for testing
- **Docker** for containerization
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

## Rationale

**React + TypeScript** provides the best balance of developer productivity, ecosystem maturity, and type safety for frontend development. The large talent pool and extensive documentation reduce onboarding time.

**Node.js + TypeScript** maintains language consistency across the stack, enabling full-stack developers and code sharing between frontend and backend. Fastify provides better performance than Express while maintaining familiar patterns.

**PostgreSQL** offers robust features, excellent performance, and strong consistency guarantees needed for business applications.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent language (TypeScript) across frontend and backend
- Large talent pool familiar with React and Node.js
- Excellent tooling and IDE support
- Strong type safety reduces runtime errors
- Mature ecosystem with extensive third-party libraries

### Negative
- Node.js performance limitations for CPU-intensive tasks
- JavaScript ecosystem complexity and frequent changes
- Potential for analysis paralysis due to numerous library choices
- Bundle sizes can be larger compared to some alternatives

### Neutral
- Team needs training on TypeScript best practices
- Development tooling setup requires initial configuration
- Regular dependency updates needed due to fast-moving ecosystem

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Set up development environment and tooling (Week 1-2)
2. **Phase 2**: Create boilerplate templates and project structure (Week 3-4)
3. **Phase 3**: Team training and documentation (Week 5-6)
4. **Phase 4**: Pilot project implementation (Week 7-10)
5. **Phase 5**: Full rollout to new projects (Week 11+)

## Notes

This decision will be reviewed quarterly and may be revised based on:
- Technology evolution and new releases
- Team feedback and productivity metrics
- Performance requirements changes
- Business needs evolution
