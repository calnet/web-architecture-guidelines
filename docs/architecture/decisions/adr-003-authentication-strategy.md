# ADR-003: Authentication Strategy

## Status

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team, Security Team  
**Supersedes**: N/A  
**Superseded by**: N/A  

## Context

We need to establish a unified authentication and authorization strategy that
works across all applications in our ecosystem. The strategy should support
modern security practices, provide good developer experience, and scale with our
growing user base while integrating well with the technology stack from ADR-001.

## Decision Drivers

- Security best practices and compliance requirements
- Developer experience and ease of implementation
- Scalability for growing user base
- Integration with existing systems and third-party services
- Support for multiple client types (web, mobile, API)
- Token management and session handling
- Multi-factor authentication support

## Options Considered

### Authentication Approaches

1. **Session-Based Authentication**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, server-side session control, familiar pattern

- Cons: Scalability issues, not suitable for microservices, mobile app
challenges

1. **JWT Token-Based Authentication**
   - Pros: Stateless, good for microservices, mobile-friendly, self-contained

- Cons: Token revocation challenges, potential security issues if misconfigured

1. **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**
   - Pros: Industry standard, third-party integration, delegation support

- Cons: Complex implementation, requires external provider or custom
implementation

1. **Hybrid Approach (JWT + Refresh Tokens)**
   - Pros: Balance of security and usability, proper token lifecycle management
   - Cons: Increased complexity, requires careful implementation

## Decision

We have decided to implement a **Hybrid JWT-Based Authentication Strategy** with
the following components:

### Core Authentication System

1. **JWT Access Tokens**
   - Short-lived (15 minutes)
   - Contains minimal user information and permissions
   - Signed with RS256 (asymmetric keys)
   - Stateless verification

1. **Refresh Token Strategy**
   - Long-lived (7 days, configurable)
   - Stored securely in httpOnly cookies
   - Single-use with rotation on refresh
   - Database-tracked for revocation capabilities

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) support
   - SMS backup option for critical accounts
   - Recovery codes for account recovery

### Implementation Architecture

```typescript
interface AuthTokens {
  accessToken: string;      // JWT, 15min lifetime
  refreshToken: string;     // Secure token, 7 days
  tokenType: 'Bearer';
  expiresIn: number;
}

interface JWTPayload {
  sub: string;              // User ID
  iat: number;              // Issued at
  exp: number;              // Expiration
  roles: string[];          // User roles
  permissions: string[];    // Specific permissions
}
```text

### Security Standards

- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 12 characters, complexity rules
- **Rate Limiting**: Exponential backoff for failed attempts
- **Session Management**: Concurrent session limits, device tracking
- **Audit Logging**: All authentication events logged and monitored

## Rationale

**JWT with Refresh Tokens** provides the best balance of security, scalability,
and developer experience. The stateless nature of JWTs works well with our
microservices architecture while refresh tokens provide proper security
controls.

**Short-lived access tokens** minimize the impact of token compromise while
**refresh token rotation** ensures long-term security without frequent user
re-authentication.

**Multi-factor authentication** is essential for modern applications and
regulatory compliance.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Scalable authentication across microservices
- Good security posture with modern best practices
- Developer-friendly API with clear token lifecycle
- Support for various client types (web, mobile, API)
- Built-in audit trail and monitoring capabilities

### Negative

- Increased complexity compared to simple session-based auth
- Requires careful key management for JWT signing
- Clock synchronization requirements across services
- Additional infrastructure for token storage and management

### Neutral

- Team needs training on JWT security best practices
- Requires robust token refresh mechanism implementation
- Need monitoring for token usage and security events

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Core authentication service development (Week 1-3)
1. **Phase 2**: JWT token management and refresh logic (Week 4-5)
1. **Phase 3**: MFA implementation and testing (Week 6-7)
1. **Phase 4**: Integration with applications (Week 8-10)
1. **Phase 5**: Security audit and production deployment (Week 11-12)

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Authentication Service Interface
interface AuthService {
  login(credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<AuthTokens>;
  refresh(refreshToken: string): Promise<AuthTokens>;
  logout(refreshToken: string): Promise<void>;
  verifyToken(accessToken: string): Promise<JWTPayload>;
  enableMFA(userId: string): Promise<MFASetup>;
  verifyMFA(userId: string, code: string): Promise<boolean>;
}

// Middleware for protecting routes
const authenticateJWT = (requiredPermissions?: string[]) => {
  return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // JWT verification and permission checking logic
  };
};
```text

## Related Decisions

- [ADR-001]: Technology Stack Selection (defines Node.js/TypeScript usage)
- [ADR-002]: Database Schema Design Patterns (affects user and session tables)

## Security Considerations

- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Key rotation schedule (monthly for production)
- Monitoring for suspicious authentication patterns
- Integration with security incident response procedures

## Monitoring and Review

This decision will be reviewed:

- After security incidents or vulnerabilities
- Quarterly security reviews
- When adding new client applications
- When compliance requirements change
