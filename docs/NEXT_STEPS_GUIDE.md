# AI-Powered Code Review System - Next Steps Implementation Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for completing the remaining "Next
Steps" for the AI-Powered Code Review workflow system.

## Overview

The AI-Powered Code Review system v1.3.3 has been successfully implemented with:

- ✅ GitHub workflows (claude-code-review.yml, advanced-architecture-review.yml)
- ✅ Custom Claude commands (5 specialized commands)
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring and testing scripts
- ✅ Complete documentation and version management
- ✅ Enhanced automation and optimization tools

## Remaining Next Steps

### 1. Configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Repository Secret

**Status**: ⏳ Requires repository admin access

**Script**: `./scripts/configure-anthropic-secret.sh`

#### Quick Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Get your Anthropic API key from https://console.anthropic.com/
# 2. Set the repository secret using GitHub CLI
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --repo calnet/web-architecture-guidelines

# 3. Validate the secret configuration
./scripts/configure-anthropic-secret.sh --validate
```text

#### Alternative: Web Interface Setup

1. Navigate to: [Repository Secrets Settings](https://github.com/calnet/web-architecture-guidelines/settings/secrets/actions)
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
4. Value: [Your Anthropic API key]
5. Click "Add secret"

#### Validation

```bash
# Validate secret is properly configured
./scripts/configure-anthropic-secret.sh --validate

# Test workflow access to secret
./scripts/test-workflow.sh --validate-secret --dry-run
```text

### 2. Test Workflow System with Sample PR

**Status**: ⏳ Ready to execute

**Script**: `./scripts/test-workflow.sh`

#### Comprehensive Testing

```bash
# Run comprehensive validation (recommended first step)
./scripts/test-workflow.sh --dry-run

# Create actual test PR for workflow validation
./scripts/test-workflow.sh

# Test only local validation without PR creation
./scripts/test-workflow.sh --skip-pr

# Validate secret configuration during testing
./scripts/test-workflow.sh --validate-secret
```text

#### Manual Testing Scenarios

After running the test script, you can manually test:

1. **Custom Commands**: Comment on the test PR with:
   - `@claude /architecture-review`
   - `@claude /security-scan`
   - `@claude /performance-check`
   - `@claude /documentation-audit`
   - `@claude /quick-fix`

2. **Workflow Triggers**: The test PR should automatically trigger:
   - Claude Code Review workflow
   - Advanced Architecture Review workflow

3. **Template Compliance**: Test files are designed to validate:
   - Documentation template adherence
   - Architecture analysis capabilities
   - Security and performance validation

### 3. Monitor Workflow Performance and Optimize

**Status**: ⏳ Ongoing monitoring

**Script**: `./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh`

#### Real-time Monitoring

```bash
# Quick health check (default)
./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh

# Comprehensive monitoring report
./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --report

# Performance analysis
./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --performance

# Real-time dashboard
./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --dashboard

# Check for alerts and issues
./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --alerts

# Get optimization recommendations
./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --optimize

# Export metrics for analysis
./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --export-metrics
```text

#### Automated Monitoring Setup

Add to crontab for regular monitoring:

```bash
# Daily health check at 9 AM
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/repo && ./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --report

# Weekly performance analysis on Sundays
0 10 * * 0 cd /path/to/repo && ./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh --performance
```text

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Required)

- [ ] **Configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret**

  ```bash
  gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --repo calnet/web-architecture-guidelines

  ```bash
  ./scripts/test-workflow.sh --dry-run
  ```text

- [ ] **Verify all components are working**

  ```bash
  npm run validate:all
  ./scripts/monitor-workflow.sh
  ```text

### Testing Phase (Recommended)

- [ ] **Create test PR for workflow validation**

  ```bash
  ./scripts/test-workflow.sh
  ```text

- [ ] **Test custom commands**
  - Comment on test PR with each `/command`
  - Verify Claude responds appropriately

- [ ] **Monitor workflow execution**
  - Check GitHub Actions tab
  - Verify workflows complete successfully
  - Review Claude review quality

### Optimization Phase (Ongoing)
