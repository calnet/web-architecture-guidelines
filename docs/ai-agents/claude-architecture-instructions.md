## Core Principles

When discussing web application architecture, always emphasize these
foundational principles:

### Code Quality Standards

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication through
  abstraction and reusable components
- **Clean Code**: Write self-documenting, readable code with clear naming
  conventions
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov
  substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- **Type Safety**: Implement comprehensive type validation and checking
- **Maintainability**: Design for long-term evolution and team collaboration
- **No Nonessential Duplication**: Ruthlessly eliminate redundant code,
  documentation, and processes

### Architecture Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different application
  layers
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules should not depend on
  low-level modules
- **Configuration over Convention**: Make applications configurable and
  adaptable
- **Database Agnostic**: Abstract data access to support multiple database types
- **Component Integration**: Seamless module and component integration with
  clear interfaces

### Quality Assurance

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation code
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage
- **Security by Design**: Implement security considerations from the ground up
- **Accessibility**: Build inclusive applications following WCAG guidelines
- **User and Developer Friendly**: Optimize for both end-user experience and
  developer productivity

## Cross-Reference Integration Map

## Final Notes

These instructions should guide comprehensive, practical architectural advice
that balances current needs with future scalability. Always emphasize the
importance of starting simple and evolving the architecture as requirements
become clearer and the system grows in complexity.

Remember to validate architectural decisions through prototyping, testing, and
measurement rather than theoretical optimization. The best architecture is one
that solves real problems efficiently while remaining maintainable and adaptable
to changing requirements.
